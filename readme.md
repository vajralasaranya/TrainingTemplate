# Hackathon Template
This template is provided to help introduce the workflow of the Simpson College
 hackathon team to new members.

In this readme are various assignments to help the new member learn how to use
*Materialize CSS*, and *JQuery*.

This template is almost exactly what I will give everyone on the team once we
start the project. Each person will then begin building their own respective
features off of this template.



## Setup
1. CLone the repository
2. Open *index.html*
3. The page should look like this
4. Adjust the screen width to ensure that the site is responsive
![alt text][mobile-template]
![alt text][tablet-template]

If this all works then you are ready to begin building!

## First Project
In the first project you are going to add items to the navigation bar, and
add a card with some information on it.

You will need to look up "Material Icons". Click on the first link. These
are cool icons provided by google and you will need them!
